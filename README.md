* Key 8 to move the camera up
* key 2 to move it down
* key 4 to move it to the right
* Key 6 to move it to the left
* + to move forward
* - to move backward.
 
Rendering speed for a 4x4 map (8 cubes, 96 triangles): 4fps

Thanks to [Quantale](src/WIN_20240616_23_59_28_Pro.jpg) for his explanation.

Soon : a clean version of the code, and faster rendering
